    //     if game.cards.contains(where: sender) { ... }
    //
    // but it I happened to know it won't work because Card and sender (UIButton) aren't comparable.
    // or I should say I should make connection between model and view HERE.
    // UI Elements (View) has its attributes and Model (Cards struct) has its attributes.
    // But there's no connection between them. I have to connect them somewhere, or, here.
